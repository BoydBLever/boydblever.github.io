        Within the ancient libraries of Alexandria, scholars once debated the
        “Ladder of Abstractions,” a metaphorical device describing how thought
        ascends from raw perception to divine principle. At the base of the ladder
        are sensations—fleeting impressions like the smell of papyrus or the
        crackle of fire. Midway lies interpretation, where scribes assign symbols
        and meaning to those impressions. At the top rests synthesis, where
        disparate symbols coalesce into universal truths. Some claimed the ladder
        was infinite; others argued it terminated at silence, where language
        fails. Yet all agreed: climbing it was the essence of inquiry.
